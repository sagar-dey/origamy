    <p>About Panda</p>
    <ol>
 
        <li>Giant pandas (often referred to as simply “pandas”) are black and white bears.</li>
        <li>Giant pandas are good at climbing trees and can also swim</li>
        <li>Pandas go from pink to white and black (or brown)</li>
        <li>  In the wild, they are found in thick bamboo forests, high up in the ...
            These magnificent mammals are omnivores. </li>
        <li>Pandas are "lazy" — eating and sleeping make their day</li>
        <li> But whilst pandas will occasionally eat small animals and fish, bamboo counts for 99 percent of their diet.
        </li>
        <li>
            Pandas are BIG eaters – every day they fill their tummies for up to 12 hours, shifting up to 12 kilograms of bamboo!</li>
        <li>
            The giant panda’s scientific name is Ailuropoda melanoleuca, which means “black and white cat-foot”.

    <p>About Teddy Bears</p>
    <ul>
        
        <li>The teddy bear is normally a cub or baby bear.</li> 
        <li>
        In Russia, bears were used as children's toys for many years before they became popular in the United States. The teddy bear in Russia has been the subject of folklore or stories for many years. 
        </li>
        <li>Some people believe that teddy bears are only a children's toy but the bear is more than that.</li>
        <li>The Teddy Bears’ Picnic song was originally called The Teddy Bear Two Step</li>
        <li>The smallest commercially available stitched teddy bear is a mere 0.29 inches tall, made by South African “microbear”
        maker Cheryl Moss, whose largest creations are just taller than half an inch</li>
